[中文ReadMe](https://github.com/imgRenko/Screen-Art-THSTG-Framework-for-Unity/blob/main/READMECN.md)
This original framework has some missing art assets (except for art assets that can be used publicly). Please use your own art resources to complete it.

# Introduction
A Free and open-source STG framework.  
This framework, as the name suggests, is a framework that you can make a THSTG game easily.
This framework provides some tools for you to make your favorite STG barrage in unity more easily.
At present, this framework is not perfect, it needs some time to improve its functions（Take it easy!)
Several functions are missing: video, music room system.

# Install
Since the old version is not archived here, you can only get old version from others. Only new versions are available here. Clone this repo, and then create a new unity project to store the files you get from here according to the unity file structure. That's the first step.  
The second step is to repair the missing art resource reference. After the missing art resource reference is repaired, the framework can be used normally.
